    for keeping this is just to be consistent with the galaxies configuartion.

This is is usually the source free image (SFI), or it can also be the BnB image if you want to simulate the sources on the image where the observed BnB sources are kept. One can uses BnB image to test how the BnB sources affect the detection.

    :param psf_dict: The psf configuration. Currently it only supports Moffat PSF with beta parameter of 4.5. ``psf_dict`` must be a dictionary in the form of ``{"moffat":{ "beta": _value_, "fwhm": _value_ } }``, where _value_ of ``fwhm`` is in the unit of arcsec.

    :param fbulge_dict: The configuration of the fraction of the bulge component. It must be in the form of ``{"lo": _value_, "high": _value_}``. Note that the _value_ has to be within [0,1] and 1 means the galaxy has zero fraction of light from the disk component. By default, it is ``fbulge_dict = {"lo":0.5 , "hi":0.9  }``.

    :param pos_ang_dict: The position angle configuration of the sources simulated by **GalSim**. It is in the unit of degree. It must be in the form of ``{"lo": _value_, "high": _value_}``.

    :param sims_nameroot: The code name you want to identify this run of simulation. It is not only the name of the subdirectory for saving the images simulated in this run, but also the code name for **ComEst** to identify the simulation for the remaining analysis pipeline. IMPORTANT: Please use the consistent code name ``sims_nameroot`` for this set of simulated images throughout **ComEst**. By default, it is ``sims_nameroot = "buldisk"``.

This is is usually the source free image (SFI), or it can also be the BnB image if you want to simulate the sources on the image where the observed BnB sources are kept. One can uses BnB image to test how the BnB sources affect the detection.

    :param psf_dict: The psf configuration. Currently it only supports Moffat PSF with beta parameter of 4.5. ``psf_dict`` must be a dictionary in the form of ``{"moffat":{ "beta": _value_, "fwhm": _value_ } }``, where _value_ of ``fwhm`` is in the unit of arcsec. By default, ``psf_dict = {"moffat":{ "beta": 4.5, "fwhm": img_fwhm } }``.

The stamp is with the size of ``stamp_size_arcsec`` x ``stamp_size_arcsec`` (``stamp_size_arcsec`` in arcsec) where the **GalSim** will simulate one single source on. By default, it is ``stamp_size_arcsec = 20.0``.

    :param fbulge_dict: The configuration of the fraction of the bulge component. It must be in the form of ``{"lo": _value_, "high": _value_}``. Note that the _value_ has to be within [0,1] and 1 means the galaxy has zero fraction of light from the disk component. By default, it is ``fbulge_dict = {"lo":0.5 , "hi":0.9  }``.

    :param q_dict: The minor-to-major axis ratio configuration of the sources simulated by **GalSim**. It must be in the form of ``{"lo": _value_, "high": _value_}``. Note that the _value_ has to be within [0,1] and ``q = 1`` means spherical. By default, it is ``q_dict = {"lo":0.4 , "hi":1.0 }``.

    :param pos_ang_dict: The position angle configuration of the sources simulated by **GalSim**. It is in the unit of degree. It must be in the form of ``{"lo": _value_, "high": _value_}``. Note that the _value_ has to be within [0,180.0] and it is counter-clockwise with +x is 0 degree. By default, it is ``pos_ang_dict={"lo":0.0 , "hi":180.0 }``.

    :param ngals_arcmin2: The projected number of the sources simulated by **GalSim** per arcmin square. You dont want to set this number too high because it will cause the problem from blending in the source detection. However, you dont want to lose the statistic power if you set this number too low. By defualt, it is ``ngals_arcmin2 = 25.0``.

    :param nsimimages: The number of the images you want to simulate. It will be saved in the multi-extension file with the code name ``sims_nameroot``. By default, it is ``nsimimages = 50``.

    :param random_seed: The random seed of the random generator. It will be passed to **GalSim** for simulating the sources.

    :param sims_nameroot: The code name you want to identify this run of simulation. It is not only the name of the subdirectory for saving the images simulated in this run, but also the code name for **ComEst** to identify the simulation for the remaining analysis pipeline. IMPORTANT: Please use the consistent code name ``sims_nameroot`` for this set of simulated images throughout **ComEst**. By default, it is ``sims_nameroot = "buldisk"``.

    This function reads the ``path2image`` and put the fake galaxies on it. The properties of the fake galaxies are directly taken from **COSMOS** catalog provided by **Galsim** team and they are convolved with psf before being put on the image. In this routine, we only use ``pos_ang_dict`` to re-rotate the galaxies. Please run ``galsim_download_cosmos`` provided by **GalSim** to download the **COSMOS** catalog.  Please note that since we are resampling from the observed catalog, hence the configurations of the galaxy shape of ``hlr_dict``, ``fbulge_dict`` and ``q_dict`` do _NOT_ apply on this set of simulation. But for the sake of consistency,this routine still requires these input configuration. The simulated sources are uniformly distributed in the CCD with the number density of ``ngals_arcmin2``.

    .. seealso:: ``comest.ComEst.RealGalLocator`` for more details about the configuration.

    .. todo:: Perhaps we should add the input catalog arguments in the future.
